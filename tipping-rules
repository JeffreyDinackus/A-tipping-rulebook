How much should I tip? This question breeds ambiguity today. I will write my understanding of tipping according to my study of etiquette, please feel free to suggest changes on our GitHub. This is written with a east cost US bias in mind, if you would like to include other regions or countries, suggest a change. 





# Sit Down Restaurant Tipping

Is service excellent? 18 - 20% tip is fine, but you could go higher. 

Is service average? 14% - 18% tip is appropriate.

Is service bad but not horrible? 12% - 15% tip.

Is service horrible? In this case the proper etiquette is to talk to the manager. If the manager comps part of the meal, or give you feel food, and its to your satisfaction for the service you have received, you could leave a 12% - 18% tip If the manager refuses to fix the problems with your meal, it is fine to leave no tip, BUT if you are on a date, leaving something is probably a better move to give the right impression. 

# Fast Casual Tipping

If you do not have a waiter, you are not required to tip. If service is really good, a 10% - 15% tip is fine. 



# Coffee Shop Tipping

A coffee shop is asking for a tip? You are not need to tip. If you do tip, a $1 tip on a $5 - $6 bill is fine, you could even do less, as a $1 tip on $5 is 20%, which is too high for the service they are providing, on $6 it is 16.6%, which is high for the service they are providing. Realistically, 8% - 12% is better, but that requires putting a custom tip and doing a calculation.
