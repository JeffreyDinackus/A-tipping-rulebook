How much should I tip? This question breeds ambiguity today. I will write my understanding of tipping according to my study of etiquette, please feel free to suggest changes on our GitHub. This is written with a east coast United States bias in mind, if you would like to include other regions or countries, suggest a change.

# Sit Down Restaurant Tipping

Tipping is generally pre-tax. This is because the tax the government charges on your meal is not a service the restaurant provides. Taxes can also vary wildly depending on the county / city. This is also recommended by Peggy Post. 

Is the service excellent? 18-20% tip is fine, but you could go higher. 

Is the service average? 14%-18% tip is appropriate. 

Is the service bad but not horrible? 12%-15% tip. 

Is the service horrible? In this case the proper etiquette is to talk to the manager. If the manager comps part of the meal, or give you free food, or some other gesture such as a apology, and its to your satisfaction for the service you have received, you could leave a 12%-18% tip. If the manager refuses to fix the problems with your meal or is rude to you, it is fine to leave no tip. However, if you are on a date, leaving something is probably a better move to give the right impression. Generally its best to not eat at that restaurant again if you leave no tip, as you don't want them to spit in your food or something. If you plan on coming back, leaving something is probably wise. 

# Fast Casual / Fast Food Tipping

If you do not have a waiter, you are not required to tip. If service is really good or they do something special, a 6%-12% tip is fine. 

# Takeout Tipping

10%-15% is fine. Tip more for large or complex orders, something higher is more appropriate, such as perhaps 15%-20%.

# Coffee Shop Tipping

A coffee shop is asking for a tip? You are not obliged to tip. If you do tip, a $1 tip on a $5-$6 bill is fine, you could even do less, as a $1 tip on $5 is 20%, which is  high for the service they are providing, on $6 it is 16.6%, which is more reasonable. 

# Delivery Driver Tipping

It's good to generously tip these folks, they are working hard and putting miles on their vehicles. 3$-6$ minimum, or 10%-20%, whichever is higher. If service is good or excellent, tip more if you can. 

# Valet Driver Tipping

$2-$5 when car is returned, make sure to check for scratches or damage to your car first. 

# Retail Store Tipping

If the grocery store or another retail store asks you to round up the bill for charity, you are not obliged to do so. If you are shopping at a business run by a charity, such as Goodwill, and you find something that is a really good value or get good service, rounding up to support them is fine, but you are not obligated to.
